Subject: [PATCH 2/2] drivers: chipidea: disable runtime-pm for imx6ul

Colibri iMX6ULL does not properly work with runtime-pm enabled. We see
two issues with that enabled:

1. Runtime PM disconnects the line as it thinks there is no VBUS -
   because this signal is not hooked up in hardware. The driver gets a
   wakeup signal from the attached hub after about 2s which leads to a
   reset loop.
2. In Dual-Role switching mode usb-device is not detected when plugged
   in. The reason was never fully understood.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [Configuration for colibri-imx6ull]
